This project is to create a Python program that can transform any given image into a cartoon-like representation. The program will utilize image processing techniques to apply a cartoonish effect to the input image, resulting in a visually appealing and stylized output.
Python libraries used in this project:
1. OpenCV (cv2): pip install opencv-python.
2. Install easygui using pip.
3. Install NumPy (np) using pip.
4. pip install imageio.
5. pip install matplotlib.
6. Tkinter is Python's de facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library. It is a thin, object-oriented overlay on top of Tcl/Tk. If you're using a regular Python installation, there's no need to install it individually because it's included in most standard Python deployments. If you're using a virtual environment, you may need to install it using your operating system's package manager or with pip install tk (for some circumstances).
7. Pillow (PIL): pip install pillows
