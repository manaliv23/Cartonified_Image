This project is to create a Python program that can transform any given image into a cartoon-like representation. The program will utilize image processing techniques to apply a cartoonish effect to the input image, resulting in a visually appealing and stylized output.

Python libraries used in this project:
1. OpenCV (cv2): pip install opencv-python
2. easygui: pip install easygui
3. NumPy (np): pip install numpy
4. imageio: pip install imageio
5. matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
6. tkinter: This is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. You don't need to install it separately if you're using a standard Python installation, as it comes bundled with most standard Python distributions. However, if you're using a virtual environment, you might need to install it using your OS's package manager or by using pip install tk (for some environments).
7. Pillow (PIL): pip install pillow

IDE: Pycharm
